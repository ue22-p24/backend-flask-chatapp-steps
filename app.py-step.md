## subscribe to the nickname channel

our next move is to subscribe to the nickname channel  
but wait, the JS code currently is static, and has no access to the nickname

we have 2 options here:

1. make the JS code a template, and instantiate it with the nickname
1. pass the nickname to the JS code **through the HTML tree**

of course this version is not functional yet, as nobody writes on that
channel yet... but we'll fix it later
